Exercise 05
Write a program that will calculate circle area (and print to the terminal), 
radius is 5 cm, 
lets's assume pi = 3.14
A=𝜋𝑟^2 (this is our formula)
expected result: e.g., 

"Circle area is: 78.5 cm2"

'''

rad = int(input("please enter the raius of the circle=  "))
area = 3.14 * rad*rad
print("circle area is",  area)
