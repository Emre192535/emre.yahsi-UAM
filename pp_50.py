'''
Write a program that will filter a list of tuple.
In order to do it, a list of tuples is given (for testing purposes)
L1 = [
â€¦
]
In your program, write a function that will return a filtered list of tuples.def filter_list(filtering_criterion, items):
# input: list of tuples
# return: filtered list of tuples
# Use loop
return price_filtered
For testing purposes, assume filter criteria : all elements that has a price greater than 15
